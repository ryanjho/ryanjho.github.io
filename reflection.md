__What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?__
- Doing this challenging helped to solidify my knowledge of the different properties associated with CSS padding, borders and margin. I learned how to use margin effectively to space out HTML elements, and also use padding to ensure that there is enough space between the element's content and its border. 
- I used to add dashed borders around each element when I was working on the design positioning, as it helped me to visualize how each HTML element was occupying the page. This helped me to identify the appropriate styling method to use to get my desired effect.

__What did you learn about CSS positioning?__
- I learned that CSS positioning, if done well, makes styling the page very easy and straightforward. Using classes and IDs help to add useful layers into the design process, which allows the developer to make changes to the website easily. I also learned that it takes quite a bit of practice to really master CSS, as there is always more than one way of styling an element.

__What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?__
- It was straightforward to implement the main design structure of my website (i.e. header, main and footer elements). However, it got slightly more challenging when I was trying to implement the finer design elements of my website - the links to my social media profiles, navigation bar and search bar, footer navigation bar, etc.) 
- It was also pretty difficult to style my blog index page, as there are multiple elements nested within each element. 

__What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?__
- I learned that it is useful to use classes for styling different elements, since I can easily change the parameters of each class, and have all the dependent elements reflect the change immediately.
- I also learned more about the different positioning properties, and how to use the float property to move HTML elements around the page.
